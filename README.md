-   [Exercise 2](https://github.com/interro-egg/tecnicofs-so/milestone/2) - [Statement](https://github.com/interro-egg/tecnicofs-so/blob/exercise-2/Enunciado-Ex2.pdf) - **[Branch](https://github.com/interro-egg/tecnicofs-so/tree/exercise-2)**.

Codebase was provided by professors.

Use `make` (= `make all`), `make clean` or `make fmt`.

To be reminded to run `make fmt` when necessary, run `./setup_hooks.sh` once to set a pre-commit hook. This may change in the future to edit files in-place in addition to aborting the commit, as a convenience.
